This mod is a re-make of the original Asgard Shield, made popular by the 1.5 modpack Hexxit.

**Giant Swords** deal more damage than the game‘s regular swords, and can block like shields, similar to Fuzs‘ mod [Golden Age Combat](https://github.com/Fuzss/goldenagecombat) (currently a 1.12.2/1.14.4 feature only)! They‘re crafted using six pieces of the respective material.

**Shields** (currently a 1.12.2 feature only) have special perks and weaknesses, giving each shield its unique purpose. They‘re crafted using leather and six pieces of the respective material and can be upgraded with gold for improved stats.
